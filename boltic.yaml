# This is a containerized app; weâ€™ll let Boltic use your Dockerfile
build:
  dockerfile: "Dockerfile"  # optional; default is 'Dockerfile' in root

# If your Dockerfile already defines CMD, you can remove 'experimental'.
# If not, uncomment ONE of the following to run your server:
experimental:
  cmd:
    # Option A: run main.py via uv (common in repos with uv.lock)
    - "uv"
    - "run"
    - "python"
    - "main.py"

    # Option B (alternative): run module by name (if your package exposes CLI)
    # - "uv"
    # - "run"
    # - "mcp-server-mas-sequential-thinking"

# Runtime environment (non-secrets). Put secrets from the console (next step).
env:
  LLM_PROVIDER: "deepseek"   # or "github" | "openrouter" | "kimi" | "groq"
  # EXA is optional; only if you want research agent features
  # EXA_API_KEY: "set-in-console"

# Optional: give the container a bit more memory for multi-agent runs
